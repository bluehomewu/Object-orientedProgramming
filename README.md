Objective
---
This course aims to introduce students to object-oriented programming (OOP) and design.  

1. Understand the concepts of the OOP paradigm such as object abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.  
2. Analyze functional requirements and then design, implement and test programs that meet the requirements using OOP concepts.  
3. Implement object-oriented programs with an OOP language, e.g. JAVA.  
4. Understand object-oriented design patterns and apply them appropriately in your programs.
